\section{Data Structures}
Here are the data structures with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\hyperlink{structparams}{params} \\*Parameter structure Contains all relevant parameters for Flywheel operation. Currently there should be two instances of this structure\+: operating point and set point. You should limit your code to only ever update the set point when commanded to by the G\+UI. The operating point should update whenever you have new information about flywheel operation }{\pageref{structparams}}{}
\end{DoxyCompactList}
